A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there
has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible.
This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying.
Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure:
each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit
is a table.
